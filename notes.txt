lab03 - Get Empirical 
12-20-21

QCC:
- Do we have to consider the worst case scenarios for each search? (Binsearch is greatest # of turns, calculated with log. Linsearch is the greatest possible index)
- Could you use getTime instead of currentTimeMillis? Would it change anything? 
- How can we allocated more memory to java so that we can test cases with longer arrays?

DISCO: 
- currentTimeMillis is called by System.currentTimeMillis() 
- We did not need to make global variables 
- Instead of finding the time it takes for one individual Bin/LinTime to run, we can find the time it takes to run multiple ones
