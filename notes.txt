lab03 - Get Empirical 
12-20-21

QCC:
- Could you use getTime instead of currentTimeMillis? Would it change anything? 
- Should we allocated more memory to java so that we can test cases with longer 
  arrays?

DISCO: 
- currentTimeMillis is called by System.currentTimeMillis() 
- We did not need to make global variables 
- Instead of finding the time it takes for one individual Bin/LinTime to 
  run, we can find the time it takes to run multiple ones
- The best case for BinSearch would be the middle number, while the best case
  for LinSearch would be the first value in the array 
- The worst case of BinSearch would be the first or last element in the array, 
  while the worst case for LinSearch would be the last value in the array 

Gallery Tour:
- Un-upTownLeopardRock
    - Different machines had different length limits (in terms of run time)
    - Used 2^29 as a length because it's close to the maximum that an int can
      store 
    - First case was longer than the others 
- LYJ
    - Used a worst case and a random case 
        - Worst was more important 
    - Could have an array over 10M but the computers took too long 
- EMP_TeamIncreadiblyCohesive
    - Created a method that does 'System.out.println' so you don't need to 
      write it out over and over again 
    - Had a best and worst test case 
    - Overall, had more methods than our code
