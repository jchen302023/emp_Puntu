lab03 - Get Empirical 
12-20-21

Goal: 
- Bin v. Lin -> Find the average time it takes for each trial to run the code. 

How:
- Create 2 files (BinSearch and LinSearch)
- Timemills in the Driver File (tracks amount of time)

Driver File: 
- BinTime 
  - Tracks the amount of time it takes for bin search to run 
    - Uses vars binStart, binEnd, binTot
- LinTime 
  - Tracks the amount of time it takes for lin search to run 
    - Uses vars linStart, linEnd, linTot

Trials:
- Test each 5 times for both Bin and Lin
- 10K repititions, find the average, use that to get final answer 
- Looks for worst case (last num in array)

Arrays:
- Ascending numerical order using a for loop (0, 1, 2, 3 etc.) 
- Tested lengths:
  - [1 K], [10 K], [100 K], [1 M], [10 M]
