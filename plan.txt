Goal: 
- Bin v. Lin -> Find the average time it takes for each trial to run the code. 

How:
- Create 2 files (BinSearch and LinSearch)
- Timemills in the Driver File (tracks amount of time)

Driver File: 
- BinTime 
  - Tracks the amount of time it takes for bin search to run 
    - Uses vars binStart, binEnd, binTot
- 
LinTime Start (returns time when you first start running Lin)
LinTime End (returns time when you finish running)
LinTime Difference = End - Start (time it took to run the code) 

Trials for [100], [1000], [10,000], each test 5 times for both Bin and Lin. 
=> 30 total trials 
Each array is filled from ascending numerical order using a for loop (0, 1, 2, 3 etc.)
