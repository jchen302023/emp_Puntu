Goal: Bin v. Lin. Find the average time it takes for each trial to run the code. 

Create 2 files; One for BinSearch, One for LinSearch
TimeMillis in the Driver file

BinTime Start
BinTime End
BinTime Difference = End - Start 

LinTime Start (returns time when you first start running Lin)
LinTime End (returns time when you finish running)
LinTime Difference = End - Start (time it took to run the code) 

Trials for [100], [1000], [10,000], each test 5 times for both Bin and Lin. 
=> 30 total trials 
Each array is filled from ascending numerical order using a for loop (0, 1, 2, 3 etc.)
