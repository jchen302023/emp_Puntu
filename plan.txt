Goal: 
- Bin v. Lin -> Find the average time it takes for each trial to run the code. 

How:
- Create 2 files (BinSearch and LinSearch)
- Timemills in the Driver File (tracks amount of time)

Driver File: 
- BinTime 
  - Tracks the amount of time it takes for bin search to run 
    - Uses vars binStart, binEnd, binTot
- LinTime 
  - Tracks the amount of time it takes for lin search to run 
    - Uses vars linStart, linEnd, linTot

Trials:
- [1 M], [10 M], [100 M]
  - subject to change depending on runtime 
- Test each 5 times for both Bin and Lin
  - 30 total trials 

Arrays:
- Ascending numerical order using a for loop (0, 1, 2, 3 etc.)
