### - Tests Performed: 
- Filled an Array with 100000000 integers, ran BinSearch and LinSearch 5 times each on it. We then calculated the average time it took for both to find integer 80001.
- Filled an Array with 100000000 integers, ran BinSearch and LinSearch 5 times each on it. We then calculated the average time it took for both to find integer 1000000.
### - Results:
- Jacc's computer can't go over 10^9 (100 million)
- Anjini's computer can't go over 
- Array of 100000000 int, searching for 80001
    - BinSearch (0 - 4 milliseconds) avg => 0 milliseconds
    - LinSearch (2 - 3 milliseconds) avg => 2.5 milliseconds
- Array of 100000000 int, searching for 1000000
    - BinSearch (0 - 1 milliseconds) avg => 0 milliseconds
    - LinSearch (4 - 6 milliseconds) avg => 5 milliseconds 

### - Conclusion:
- Binary Searches operate faster than Linear Searches (especially with numbers at higher indexes)
- My computer doubles as a radiator too
