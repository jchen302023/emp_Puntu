### - Tests Performed: 
- Filled an Array with 1000000 integers, ran BinSearch and LinSearch 5 times each on it. We then calculated the average time it took for both to find integer 80001.
    - BinSearch (0 - 4 milliseconds) Avg -> 0
    - LinSearch (2 - 3 milliseconds) Avg -> 2.5 

### - Results:
- Jacc's computer can't go over 10^9 (100 million)
- Anjini's computer can't go over 

### - Conclusion:
